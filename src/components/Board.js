     * -- Board Component --
     * Board component holds Board state and Row state
     * Board needs to render Rows,
     * Rows render Squares.
     * Does Board even need state??
     * Holds 6 rows.
     * One huge state variable ?? Probably not.
     * Board passes state down to Row.
     * Each row renders 5 squares with values of Row state passed down by board.
     * Row calls a function to update Board state with a 5 letter guess.
     * Need state for each individual Row, but that is not DRY
     * There must be a better way. Probably utilizing Array.map()
     * Cannot think of a better way. Just going to implement how I know and
     * worry about refactoring later.
     * Need an event listener which calls a function that
     * appends a letter to an array of length 5 which represents the row state.?
     * If the event is the Enter key from the event listener, board state should be updated?
     * But if its a letter, square state is updated.
     * Really, the Board ONLY needs to know what guess the user is on, and if the user has already won.
     * The Rows and Squares handle themselves.
     *
     * -- Row Component --
     * Row component holds square state
     * Row gets its state from Squares
     * Holds 5 squares.
     * Square state can be kept here?
     * Square only needs to update Row,
     * Row enters guess which lives in Board state.
     * Square calls a function to update Row state.
     * Need an array of 5 letters as a guess.
     *
     * -- Square Component --
     * Need an array of 6 guesses as state.
     * Updates when user enters a guess letter.
     * Updates as user types into squares.
     *
     * Need boolean game over state.
